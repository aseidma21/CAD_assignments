# Intermediate CAD
Assignments: Design Tables, Advanced and Mechanical Mates

## Design Tables: 
What it made: Spools of six different sizes with holes in them

What I learned: How to make many different sizes in one part by just adding the dimensions and other information into a table

Struggles: I struggled to make the design table and figure out how to add the dimensions because I kept clicking on the part and it would bring me to the icloud mail

## Advanced and Mechanical mates
What it made: Three boxes and a pin assembled so that when you slid the pin, the boxes follow it in or out

What I learned: How to make each size of a part a different color, how to mate the pin so that the opther boxes would follow it, and how to add each size of a part to an assembly

Struggles: It was hard to make each size a different color, and at first I assembled it wrong
